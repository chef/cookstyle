      # When using properties in a custom resource you shouldn't set a property to
      # be both required and a name_property. Name properties are a way to optionally
      # override the name given to the resource block in cookbook code. In your resource
      # code you use the name_property and if the user doesn't pass in anything to that
      # property its value will be populated with resource block's name. This
      # allows users to provide more friendly resource names for logging that give
      # additional context on the change being made.
      #
      # How about a nice example! Here we have a resource called ntp_config that has a
      # name_property of config_file. All throughout the code of this resource we'd
      # use new_resource.config_file when referencing the path to the config.
      #
      # We can use a friendly name for the block and specific a value to config_file
      # ntp_config 'Configure the main config file' do
      #   config_file '/etc/ntp/ntp.conf'
      #   action :create
      # end
      #
      # We can also just set the config path as the resource block and Chef will
      # make sure to pass this in as new_resource.config_file as well.
      # ntp_config '/etc/ntp/ntp.conf' do
      #   action :create
      # end
      #
      # The core tenant of the name property feature is that these properties are optional
      # and making them required effectively turns off the functionality provided by name
      # properties. If the goal is to always require the user to pass the config_file property
      # then it should just be made a required property and not a name_property.
      #
      #
      # @example
      #
      #   # bad
      #   property :config_file, String, required: true, name_property: true
      #
      #   # good
      #   property :config_file, String, required: true
      #
