description: |-
  Resources written in the class based HWRP style should inherit from the 'Chef::Resource' class and not the 'ChefCompat::Resource' class from the deprecated compat_resource cookbook.

   # better
   Write a custom resource using the custom resource DSL and avoid class based HWRPs entirely
