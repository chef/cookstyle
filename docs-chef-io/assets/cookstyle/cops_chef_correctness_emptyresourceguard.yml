description: "Resource guards (not_if/only_if) should not be empty strings as empty
  strings will always evaluate to true. \nThis will cause confusion in your cookbooks
  as the guard will always pass.\n\nEmpty strings in Ruby are \"truthy\", which means:\n-
  `only_if ''` will ALWAYS execute the resource (guard always passes)  \n- `not_if
  ''` will NEVER execute the resource (guard always blocks)\n\nThis behavior is usually
  unintended and can lead to resources running when they shouldn't\nor never running
  when they should."

  ### incorrect

  ```ruby
  template '/etc/foo' do
    mode '0644'
    source 'foo.erb'
    only_if ''  # This will always be true - resource always executes
  end

  cookbook_file '/logs/foo/error.log' do
    source 'error.log'
    not_if { '' }  # This will always be true - resource never executes
  end

  service 'apache2' do
    action :restart
    only_if { '' }  # Block form also problematic
  end
  ```

  ### correct

  ```ruby
  template '/etc/foo' do
    mode '0644'
    source 'foo.erb'
    only_if 'test -f /etc/foo'  # Actual shell command
  end

  cookbook_file '/logs/foo/error.log' do
    source 'error.log'
    not_if { ::File.exist?('/logs/foo/error.log') }  # Proper Ruby expression
  end

  service 'apache2' do
    action :restart
    only_if { node['platform'] == 'ubuntu' }  # Meaningful condition
  end

  # Or simply remove the guard if no condition is needed
  package 'curl' do
    action :install
  end
