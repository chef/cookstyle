# Cookstyle - Sane rubocop defaults for Chef Cookbooks

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/cookstyle.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/cookstyle) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef/cookstyle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chef/cookstyle)

Cookstyle is a set of opinions about Ruby code that are specific to Chef cookbooks. Running both cookstyle and RuboCop on the same codebase will result, by design, in changes being applied and then removed. Needless to say you should _not_ use both tools on the same cookbook.

Cookstyle is infrequently updated, since the rule set is mature and fairly stable. We update Cookstyle to the latest RuboCop engine yearly in April to coincide with the yearly major version bump of Chef. This yearly release will introduce new warnings to existing cookbook codebases due to new and updated RuboCop rules being enabled.

Cookstyle is included in the ChefDK / Workstation and can be used from the command line by running `cookstyle`.

The active ruleset is in the [config/cookstyle.yml](https://github.com/chef/cookstyle/blob/master/config/cookstyle.yml) file. Changes to the rule set must be accompanied by arguments and code demonstrating why the change should be made, and in most cases we would expect the author of the change to help with updating the core community cookbooks.

## How It Works

The project itself is a derivative of [finstyle](https://github.com/fnichol/finstyle), but starts with all rules disabled. Cookstyle has a direct dependency on one specific version of RuboCop (at a time), and [patches it][patch] to load the [upstream configuration][upstream] and [custom set][config] of rule updates. When a new RuboCop release comes out, this library can rev its pinned version dependency and [re-vendor](https://github.com/chef/cookstyle/blob/master/Rakefile) the upstream configuration to determine if any breaking style or lint rules were added/dropped/reversed/etc.

## NOTE CAREFULLY ABOUT UPDATING COOKSTYLE

This is designed to allow bumping the RuboCop engine while keeping backwards compatibility with the config and not requiring all the cookbooks to update.

The [cookstyle_base.yml](https://github.com/chef/cookstyle/blob/master/config/cookstyle_base.yml) file is (essentially) the enabled.yml file from 0.37.2 (as of this writing) which is applied on top of 0.62.0 with all the rules disabled. It pins the default enabled set to 0.37.2 compatibility while running under the 0.62.0 engine.

There is no rake task for updating the `cookstyle_base.yml` file. It was generated by hand -- the Description and other fields need to be dropped out of it.

It may be necessary to edit that file (again by hand) to resolve issues with later RuboCop engines changing cop names (renaming, splitting up, etc).

Occasionally the `cookstyle_base.yml` file should be updated, which will generate a lot of work to fix every cookbook that cookstyle runs against.

When updating to a new engine the `rake vendor` task should still always be run in order to update the base set of cops and generate the default disabled.yml ruleset.

When editing the `cookstyle_base.yml` becomes too much of a PITA, it may be time to bump the engine, run `rake vendor` and then drop the new `enabled.yml` into `cookstyle_base.yml`, fix it up, and ship it and then deal with the fallout of all the new cops...

## Installation

Cookstyle is included in the [ChefDK](https://downloads.chef.io/chefdk). If you choose not to use ChefDK, you can still install Cookstyle manually using the instructions below.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cookstyle'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install cookstyle
```

## Usage

### Vanilla RuboCop

Run RuboCop as normal, simply add a `-r cookstyle` option when running:

```sh
rubocop -r cookstyle -D --format offenses
```

### cookstyle Command

Use this tool just as you would RuboCop, but invoke the `cookstyle` binary instead which patches RuboCop to load rules from the cookstyle gem. For example:

```sh
cookstyle -D --format offenses
```

### Rake

In a Rakefile, the setup is exactly the same, except you need to require the cookstyle library first:

```ruby
require "cookstyle"
require "rubocop/rake_task"
RuboCop::RakeTask.new do |task|
  task.options << "--display-cop-names"
end
```

### guard-rubocop

You can use one of two methods. The simplest is to add the `-r cookstyle` option to the `:cli` option in your Guardfile:

```ruby
guard :rubocop, cli: "-r cookstyle" do
  watch(%r{.+\.rb$})
  watch(%r{(?:.+/)?\.rubocop\.yml$}) { |m| File.dirname(m[0]) }
end
```

Alternatively you could pass the path to Cookstyle's configuration by using the `Cookstyle.config` method:

```ruby
require "cookstyle"

guard :rubocop, cli: "--config #{Cookstyle.config}" do
  watch(%r{.+\.rb$})
  watch(%r{(?:.+/)?\.rubocop\.yml$}) { |m| File.dirname(m[0]) }
end
```

### .rubocop.yml

As with vanilla RuboCop, any custom settings can still be placed in a `.rubocop.yml` file in the root of your project.
